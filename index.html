	<P> HTML. First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.
Responsive images are an important component of responsive Web design (RWD), a design strategy developed by Ethan Marcotte to cope with the amazing popularity of mobile devices for viewing the Web. Ethan recognized that the previous best practice — developing separate websites for different types of devices — simply couldn’t cope with the astonishing variety of devices Web users might employ to access the websites we build.

RWD takes a completely different approach: create a single website but let that website recognize and respond to its context. If the user has a desktop browser with a wide screen, for example, allow the website content to spread across multiple columns. On a smartphone, however, rearrange the content to confine it to a single column.

In many cases, that’s where responsive design stops — simple adjustments to layout and presentation. If that’s all we consider, however, we’re not honoring the goal of responsive design, and we’re selling our users short.

Truly responding to users’ context requires a design that considers all aspects of the experience, and that often includes images. For a real life example, consider a website such as contfont.net. That single page website has one main image and a typical set of HTML, style sheets, fonts, and JavaScript files.
